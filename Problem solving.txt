However, 


Please choose 1 sample for the line chart. 
You are also missing scatter and the regression plot. 

If you are struggling with this, please try to attend office hours to discuss the fundamentals with the instructional staff. Do not get discouraged, reach out to your SSM if you really feel lost or have an emergency. Please also utilize your tutor and learning assistant resources when in need for further help. The grade is just a placeholder till you can submit a completed work. Good luck! CG ZY.
